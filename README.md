Abstract: 
This project focuses on predicting Parkinson’s disease severity using machine learning, based on the total_UPDRS score from the Parkinson’s Telemonitoring dataset. After cleaning the data, filling in missing values, and normalizing the features, the PyCaret regression library was used to test and compare several models. The Extra Trees Regressor performed the best overall, achieving an R² of 0.9701, MAE of 1.0462, and RMSE of 1.8292. These results show that tree-based ensemble models can effectively learn patterns in voice-related features to predict disease progression. Overall, the project demonstrates how automated machine learning tools make it easier and faster to build, evaluate, and deploy accurate prediction models.
